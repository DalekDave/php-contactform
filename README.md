PHP contact form
==================

This is a contact form written in PHP and Javascript, with file attachment upload feature. The form works without any database, so it's a good solution for a contact form to be displayed in the event of an outage of some service on your server, because it only requires the availability of PHP code execution.

I originally created this repository just to host the code of a contact form while I worked on troubleshooting a bug in the file attachments upload feature.
