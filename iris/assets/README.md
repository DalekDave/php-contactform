This folder contains the subdirectories 'css' and 'js'.
Usually, you won't have to make any changes in the 'js' directory.
But you'll probably want to customize the CSS styles in the 'css' directory.
In the 'iris.css' file, there is a light theme styling, using only the original 
styles necessary for the package.
In the 'iris-dark.css', there are the same styles as above (only adapted for 
a dark theme appearance), but also other styles for my particular site.
